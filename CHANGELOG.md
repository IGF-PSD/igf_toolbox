## Future Warning

A `weights` argument has been introduced in most `numpy` operators in version 2.1. As soon as they have been integrated into `pandas`, they will render the functions of `igf_toolbox.stats_des.weighted` and most of the methods of `igf_toolbox.stats_des.base.StatDesGroupBy obsolete`.
